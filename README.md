Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

EDA actually reveals ground truth about the content without making any underlying assumptions. This is the fact that data scientists use this process to actually understand what type of modeling and hypotheses can be created. Key components of exploratory data analysis include summarizing data, statistical analysis, and visualization of data.

Python provides expert tools for exploratory analysis, with pandas for summarizing; scipy, along with others, for statistical analysis; and matplotlib and plotly for visualizations...!
